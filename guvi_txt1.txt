History: GUVI was started as a YouTube channel in 2011. Arun Prakash was the first graduate in his family. The 33 year old completed his B.Tech from Sethu Institute of Technology, Virudhunagar, Tamil Nadu. As his family could not afford it, he did not own a computer and brushed up his technical skills by writing programmes on paper and running them on computers at an internet café. His professional journey for the next 13 years went off well with stints at Honeywell-Aerospace, KLA-Tencor and Kalido. Then in 2011, Arun, his wife Sridevi (32) and his friend S.P. Balamurugan (32) conceptualised the idea of GUVI. At that time, they were all working together at PayPal and decided to quit to dedicate more time to GUVI.  Chennai based GUVI provides a platform to connect budding technologists with industry experts and bridges the skill gap needed in IT companies, by sharing their technical learning as courses in vernacular languages and through a personalised mentorship programme. The channel posted video tutorials, courses, and practice materials created by Arun Prakash, Sridevi Arun Prakash, and SP Balamurugan. Co-founder Sridevi Arun Prakash died on 20 September 2020 due to Breathing problem.

On the startup's beginnings: Arun says, GUVI started as a volunteering activity when we were working at PayPal in 2011. We started off with videos explaining technical jargon in native languages like Tamil, Telugu, Hindi, Bengali and Kannada. We got amazing feedback from learners not only from India but across the globe like UK, Canada, Germany, France, US, Singapore.” The trio started GUVI with a seed capital of Rs 10 lakh until GUVI was incubated by IITM’s RTBI, an online mentoring or learning platform, focussed on IT-based technical learning in vernacular languages. The startup was then rewarded with a seed fund of Rs. five lakh. GUVI was officially launched in November 2014 and its YouTube channel has gained more than one million views and has more than 5,000 subscribers. Balamurugan holds MCA and MBA from Anna University. Before starting GUVI, he was a technologist at PayPal. Sridevi did her BE in CS from SASTRA University and her career at Honeywell-Aerospace was followed by stints at TCS and PayPal. Customer-acquisition phase GUVI acquired its first paid customer through YouTube. He was from UK and wanted mentorship to learn design patterns in Java. Each course by GUVI is a blend of video lectures that focus on context-based learning, short notes, coding playground, assignment and assessment. The video lectures are in vernacular languages, while the text contents are in English. The platform allows users the option to choose the language of his/her choice.

Review in DevOps: I joined the DevOps engineering course in Guvi. I am fresher, and I have a little bit of fear in understanding the concept, but my mentor, in guvi, has taught the concept clearly by using a well-structured ppt, and he provided practical classes on the topics. Because of this, I understand the theory and practicals of different DevOps tools. In my dashboard, the class recording is also available, which helps me to recap the topics if we have any doubts.

Review in Digital Marketing: 4 months of journey of my life one step ahead what I was in past and I leaned lot of new term of words in digital marketing. Thankyou so much for better career journey in my life.

Review in Testing: Java Selenium course on GUVI was well-structured and highly informative. The instructors explained complex concepts clearly with practical examples. Our coordinator Rekha was very supportive in clarifying doubts about the course structure and consistently followed up on tasks and next steps. Overall, it's a great course for anyone starting in test automation.

Review in UI/UX: Joined Guvi's UI/UX course and gained valuable industry knowledge through their well-structured course material, experienced mentors, and hands-on practice sessions. The mentors are supportive and come from strong professional backgrounds. However, I found the doubt-clearing sessions less effective, and there is limited personalized support and no live project exposure. Certification has been delayed, and there’s no placement assistance. I'm currently seeking job opportunities—if anyone can refer me, I’d truly appreciate it. Enrolling in the UI/UX Design course at Guvi was a remarkable experience that enhanced my skills and knowledge in the field. The mentor's teaching method was clear, engaging, and easy to grasp, making the learning process enjoyable. Their commitment to promptly resolving my doubts was commendable, and Guvi's dedication to offering an exceptional learning experience has equipped me for future career challenges. I am delighted to be a part of the Guvi Platform. The last sep 24 I was joined Advanced digital marketing in GUVI zen in native language. Especially mentor vallapakumar sir he gives lot of experience what is he had with simple way of learning and friendliness. The other coordinators assist the all queries immediately and what if they possibly.

Review in Data Science: I have completed the course of Data Science and Machine Learning from guvi which was very helpful in learning basics of Python Programming, Data Science and Machine Learning concepts. It helped me in data analysis in my current carrier field and enhanced me in writing the effective SQL queries as well. Anyone with no expertise in programming can join this course and the mentors will help them in learning the concepts from the basics. So that any non- technical background person can learn these concepts very easily. So overall it was a great experience to learn this course at Guvi. Also, I look forward for more such experiences in future as well. Thank you Guvi team for providing such an opportunity to me.The Data science course was so good the topics was well structured. I have learned programming, algorithms, databases and machine learning concepts.The Course was really helpful in understand the basic knowledge about Data science. Now it's in our hands. I like the intension of the course but time is too short as I am working professional. my good luck is I got a job In a software company.

Review in DevOps: I joined Devops master program in Guvi. I liked their syllabus which covers maximum industry needed devops tools. In the preboot session we try to analyze the syllabus framed by Guvi and the basic structure of Devops .  The daily tasks and assessment help us to be on the track of sessions.  The video recording  is very useful to revise topics and clear doubts using a query in zen portal.  Yasmin is our mentor. She teaches slowly and whenever we ask doubts she clears us by explaining with realtime examples in an organized manner. The placement process team also provides us mock interviews , resume building session weekly assessment and Informing us about Job requirements and guiding for the process . Thankyou Guvi for such good resource sharing.

Review in JavaScript: I am learning from GUVI since 6 months and have done many courses till date and according to me JavaScript is a well-delivered course where a noob/beginner can start his journey in JavaScript due to it's course content and well explanatory modules.GUVI hold's a special place in my career journey. At the outset i had concern's about the culture, fitting in ,and being valued as a newcomer. However GUVI surpassed my expectations in more ways than one.

I suggest GUVI is the best choice."

What makes GUVI different : It provides vernacular courses which make it easy to understand & practice platforms like CodeKata & WebKata, all these helped me improve my practical programming skills in the front end, back end.

Codekata is very damn helpful to crack placements because it improved my efficiency in coding... we just need to be persistent and that’s all it takes. I am very happy to encounter GUVI!"
